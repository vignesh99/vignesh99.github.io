Put together some content which I felt were quite ingenious and powerful. Most of them are just functions of existing python libraries. While some of them are for enhancing computational speed, some others are for convinience which you didn't know you could have!  

- [Pickle](#pickle)
- [Subprocess](#subprocess)

[//]: # "- [Map](#map)"

## Pickle

```Python
from pickle import dump
from pickle import load
                                    #Use load to feed data to variable
names = load(open('greekgods.pkl', 'rb'))
print(names)
                                    #Store required data using dump
flip = shuffle(names)
dump(flip, open('flipped.pkl', 'wb'))
```

## Subprocess

```Python
import subprocess
                                    #String containing your command to run on terminal
filename = "HelloWorld.py"
args = ["python3 "+filename]        #We want to run "python3 HelloWorld.py"

                                    #Run the command on terminal using subprocess
popen = subprocess.Popen(args, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,shell=True)
popen.wait()
                                    #Read the output given from the terminal
output = popen.stdout.read()
output = output.decode("utf-8")
```

[//]: # "## Map"


Will add more such functions as and when I come across them..
