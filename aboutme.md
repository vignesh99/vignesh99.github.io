I am someone who is very energetic and passionate about things I like. I am a former National level Badminton player and currently represent my institute IIT Madras at various sports meets. I am an ardent sports fan and watch a broad spectrum of sports; Tennis, Football, Formula 1, Cricket, and Basketball, to name a few.  

Rafael Nadal is one of my sporting idols; his on-court intensity and never-give-up attitude is something I try to reciprocate in my daily life. Apart from him, I am also moved by the greatness and qualities of Lionel Messi, Sebastian Vettel, and Stephen Curry. Among the many things, I admire their ability to stay humble despite the fame and recognition amassed by them. I believe that sports can shape a person by giving them everlasting memories.  

I also pursue drawing and pencil sketching as a hobby. In my free time, I read novels of fiction and myth genre.
