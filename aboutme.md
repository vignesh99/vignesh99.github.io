I am someone who is very energetic and passionate about things I like. I am a former National level Badminton player and currently represent my institute IIT Madras at various sports meets.  
I am an ardent sports fan and watch a wide spectrum of sports, Tennis, Football, Formula 1, Cricket and Basketball to name a few. Rafael Nadal is one of my sporting idols, his intensity on court and never-give-up attitude is something I try to reciprocate in my daily life. Apart from him I am also moved by the greatness and qualities of Lionel Messi, Sebastian Vettel and Stephen Curry. Among the many things, I admire their ability to stay humble inspite of the fame and recognition amassed by them. I believe that sports has the abliltiy to shape a person by giving them everlasting memories.  
I also pursue drawing and pencil sketching as a hobby. In my free time I read novels of fiction and myth genre.
