As a part of the [Image Signal processing](https://github.com/vignesh99/ImageSignalProcessing-EE5175) course project I reproduced the paper "Normalized Cuts
and Image Segmentation" by _Jianbo Shi_ and _Jitendra Malik_. The normalized cut algorithm employs optimization via Rayleigh's inequality, and was found to be effective on images with distinct partitions. The algorithm's dependency on the hyperparameters has been explained in the [report](https://github.com/vignesh99/Image-Segmentation/blob/master/EE5175_Project_EE16B127.pdf). The sparsity in the graph has been exploited and the [code](https://github.com/vignesh99/Image-Segmentation) was implemented without any explicit loops; thus decreasing the run time significantly.
