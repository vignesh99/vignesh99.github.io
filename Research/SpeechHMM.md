The HMM-based recognition involved grouping the [MFCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum#:~:text=Mel%2Dfrequency%20cepstral%20coefficients%20(MFCCs,%2Da%2Dspectrum%22)) features of isolated-digit utterances using K-means clustering. The HMM models obtained for the isolated-digits using training data was concatenated, to predict the continous speech utterances. The [report](https://github.com/vignesh99/SpeechTechnology-CS6300/blob/master/Mini%20Project%202/Mini%20Project%202%20HMMs.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/vignesh99/SpeechTechnology-CS6300/blob/master/HMMs.ipynb) can be looked into for further details.
