I gave a talk on transceiver optimization for THP (Tomlinson-Harashima Precoded) MIMO systems as a part of the course Multi-Antenna Digital Communications. The talk revolved around understanding multiplicative Schur convex objective functions and how the implications of the work can be understood using already known concepts. Here are the [slides](https://github.com/vignesh99/Transceiver-Optimization-MIMO-systems/blob/master/Presentation.pdf) from the talk and the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4567648) by _Alberto Dâ€™Amico_ that was expounded.
