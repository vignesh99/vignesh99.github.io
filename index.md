### Welcome to my website!!
I am currently a PhD student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering department](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. I am guided by [Prof. Naresh Shanbhag](https://shanbhag.ece.illinois.edu/). I have previously worked at [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) as a Silicon Design Engineer. I completed my B.Tech (Hons) and M.Tech degrees from the [Electrical Engineering Department](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/) at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I did my Master's thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Andreas Burg](https://people.epfl.ch/andreas.burg/?lang=en) at the Telecommunications and Circuits Laboratory, EPFL. During my time at IIT Madras, I also worked under [Prof. Janakiraman Viraraghavan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/janakiraman/) and [Prof. A.N. Rajagopalan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~raju/) as a research assistant.  

My academic interests lie at the interface of VLSI, Signal Processing and Machine Learning. This webpage consists of activities that have influenced my affinity towards these fields.
