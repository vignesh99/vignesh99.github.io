### Welcome to my website!!
I am a final-year dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) student at the [Electrical Engineering Department](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/), Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Currently, I am doing my Master's thesis on energy-efficient hardware design for Machine Learning under [Prof. Janakiraman Viraraghavan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/janakiraman/). I am also a  research assistant at the Image Processing and Computer Vision ([IPCV](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/)) lab under [Prof. A.N. Rajagopalan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~raju/).  
My academic interests lie in the overlap of VLSI and Signal Processing. This webpage consists of activities that have influenced my affinity towards these fields.
