### Welcome to my website!!
I am currently working at [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) as a Silicon Design Engineer. I completed my B.Tech and M.Tech degrees from the [Electrical Engineering Department](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/) at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I did my Master's thesis on flexible and hardware-efficient implementation of QC-LDPC deocder for 5G New Radio under the guidance of [Prof. Andreas Burg](https://people.epfl.ch/andreas.burg/?lang=en) at the Telecommunications and Circuits Laboratory, EPFL. During my time at IIT Madras, I also worked

Currently, I am doing my Master's thesis on energy-efficient hardware design for Machine Learning under [Prof. Janakiraman Viraraghavan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/janakiraman/). I am also a  research assistant at the Image Processing and Computer Vision ([IPCV](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/)) lab under [Prof. A.N. Rajagopalan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~raju/).  

My academic interests lie at the interface of VLSI and Signal Processing. This webpage consists of activities that have influenced my affinity towards these fields.
